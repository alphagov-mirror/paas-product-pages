Our safety measures
-------------------

The platform is designed to meet both the [Cloud Security
Principles](/cloud-security-principles) and the common security needs of
data classified as ‘OFFICIAL’:

-   data in transit is protected by HTTPS from the client to the
    platform
-   apps communicate with each other through private LANs using
    [Silk](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/silk). Silk uses
    [VXLAN](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7348) to address private
    virtual network address spaces. Cloud Foundry network policies use
    [iptables](https://linux.die.net/man/8/iptables) to stop unwanted
    communication between apps.
-   connections from your application to backing services require TLS
-   we host on Amazon Web Services (AWS) - their physical security
    procedures are [robust and
    audited](http://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_CESG_UK_Cloud_Security_Principles.pdf)
-   data in backing services can be encrypted at rest
-   separation between users of the platform is enforced by Cloud
    Foundry’s internal authentication and access control system
-   Linux containers provide the boundary between running application
    instances
-   the platform relies on robust operational security and processes
    (see below)
-   it’s possible to change and revoke your team members’ permissions
    and roles to manage the service
-   users can authenticate via single sign-on with your organisation's
    Google and Microsoft accounts
-   we use 2-factor authentication, short-lived credentials and IP
    restriction policies for identity and access management to protect
    AWS resources
-   shared credentials are rotated to minimise risk of unauthorised
    access
-   Amazon Cloudtrail audits and monitors AWS activity
-   the CloudFoundry events API provides audit information about the use
    of your service

How we manage change, vulnerabilities and incidents
---------------------------------------------------

The platform is built and maintained by a government team within the
Government Digital Service, and these are the established working
practices:

-   everyone with production access has Security Check (SC) clearance
-   code changes are approved by team members who haven’t worked on the
    feature
-   we do pair programming whenever possible
-   system configuration and access privileges are under source code
    control and so is documentation
-   control changes to the production platform are overseen by civil
    servants
-   we code in the open and our code is available in the
    [alphagov](https://github.com/alphagov) project on GitHub - search
    for the ‘paas’ repositories
-   we have a tried and tested incident management approach
-   reports of incidents are published and available on our [status
    page](https://status.cloud.service.gov.uk/history)
-   external penetration tests (IT Health Checks) of the platform are
    carried out annually and it’s our policy to address all issues
    discovered with a CVSS score of medium or above
-   when security updates become available, we start working on them
    within one working day, prioritising fixes to critical severity
    vulnerabilities
