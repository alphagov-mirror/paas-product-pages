How much GOV.UK PaaS costs and how to pay
=========================================

When you use GOV.UK PaaS, you will just pay for the resources you use.

These resources are:

-   the application memory needed to run your service
-   the databases or other data storage that we can provide for your
    service

You can adjust the amount of resources you are using at any time,
depending on what you need. You can visit [our
marketplace](https://admin.london.cloud.service.gov.uk/marketplace) to
see what backing services are available and [use our pricing calculator
to estimate the costs of hosting your
service](https://admin.london.cloud.service.gov.uk/calculator) on GOV.UK
PaaS.

The price we charge includes a 10% service fee to cover the internal
overhead of procuring and making these resources available to you, and
making sure the platform complies with information assurance standards.

included in this price are:

-   as many [users or
    organisations](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/orgs_spaces_users.html)
    as you need
-   access to our all our [support
    channels](/support-and-response-times), including 24/7 support for
    live services
-   a user friendly administration tool for managing your organisations,
    users, applications and billing
-   full access to all the [features of the platform](/features)

How to start using the paid service
-----------------------------------

We offer a free trial account to help you evaluate the platform. A trial
account offers limited features and lasts for 3 months.

To start using the paid service, your organisations will need to sign a
Crown or non-Crown Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Government
Digital Service depending on the type of organisation the service
belongs to. Contact us to find out if your organisation has signed an
MOU, or to get a copy.

Once your department has signed an MOU, you will need to:

-   [add a Billing Manager to your GOV.UK PaaS
    organisation](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/orgs_spaces_users.html#users-and-user-roles),
    who can authorise and manage payment for the service
-   email <gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk> to request
    a paid account, copying in your Billing Manager. They will need to
    authorise the request.

How to pay
----------

When you start using the paid service, we will ask you to estimate your
annual spend and send us a purchase order. After that we will send you
regular invoices.

The table below shows how often we will send you an invoice, which
depends on how much you spend.

You will start paying from your first full month of use.

### Paying with a Government Procurement Card

If you expect your annual bill to be less than £500, you will also have
the option to pay via a Government Procurement Card and would not need
to raise a purchase order.

### Paying for GOV.UK PaaS for use in the Cabinet Office

If you are using GOV.UK PaaS in the Cabinet Office then we will arrange
to account for the cost through an accounting journal raised by the GDS
Finance Business Partner with the Finance Business Partner in your
business area. This will require prior approval from your budget holder.
